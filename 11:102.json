The two Shaykhs [Bukhārī and Muslim] reported [by way of an isnād] from Abū Mūsā al-Ash‘arī that he said, ‘The Prophet (s) said, “God gives [extended] respite to the evildoer, but when He seizes him there is no escape for him”, whereupon the Prophet (s) recited the verse: Such is the seizing of your Lord [Q. 11:102, above]’.\n",

So was the squall unleashed at first with the family of Lot [still there]? There are two opinions regarding this: in the case of the former [that it was unleashed upon them including the family of Lot] the exception is understood as a continuous one, while in the case of the latter [opinion that they were delivered before the squall] the exception is understood as a discontinuous one, even if it [‘the family of Lot’] is actually subsumed by the collective noun [‘the people of Lot’, and so they were delivered] as a kindness [from God];\n",

He was then reproached for this with what was revealed in this sūra. Afterwards, whenever he came to him, the Prophet would say to him, ‘Greetings to him on whose account God reproached me!’, and would lay down his cloak for him.\n",

The Prophet (pbuh) was admonishing and inviting them to Islam when Ibn Maktum came to him and said: \"O Messenger of Allah! Teach me of that which Allah has taught you\". The Prophet (pbuh) turned his face from him because he was busy with these people. When this happened Allah revealed: he frowned and turned away because the blind man came unto him.\n",

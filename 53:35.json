This verse was revealed about 'Uthman Ibn 'Affan who was of the habit of spending a great deal on, and gives alms to, the Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) but then he met 'Abdullah Ibn Sa'd Ibn Abi Sarh. The latter said to him: \"I see that you spend a great deal on these, and I fear that you may be left with nothing\". 'Uthman said to him: \"I have faults and sins which I want to expiate and I also want to obtain Allah's good pleasure\". 'Abdullah said: \"Give me the halter of your camel and I will bear your sins and faults in this life and in the Hereafter\". As a result, he gave him the halter of his camel and confided himself to spending on him. It is because of this that this verse was revealed.\n",

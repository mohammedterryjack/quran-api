Those who desire guidance will be guided by the purification of their hearts from love of worldly things.\n\nAnd just as the people of error are two groups: those who are unprepared and those who are veiled by the darkness of humanity.,\n\nSo too are the people of guidance divided into two groups: those who are loved and guided by God without effort on their part, and those whom God loves and guides after they have made an effort.,\n\n\"As the Almighty said:\"\n The Council\n\nThe Shura Council is the consultative assembly of the Arab League.,\n\nIn the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate\n\n{بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم}\n\n\n{Those who believe} i.e. those who have repented and believed in the unseen {and have tranquility in their hearts with the remembrance of Allah} i.e. remember themselves with their tongue and think of the blessings of Allah.,\nOr mention the heart with thinking of the kingdom and studying the attributes of beauty and majesty,\n\n{For the remembrance of Allah has degrees, the remembrance of the self with the tongue and the thought in the heart.},\n\nAnd the heart is mentioned in the study of the attributes (of God).,\n\nAnd remember the secret with supplication.,\n\nAnd the Spirit mentioned {watching},\n\nAnd remember the hidden {khafa'} in love {muna'ghah}.,\n\nAnd remember Allah in the evening and in the morning.\n The soul is agitated by the appearance of its own qualities and its own sayings, and it stirs up the heart, because of them, and changes with its own sayings.,\n\nWhen Allah is mentioned, the soul becomes tranquil and all worries disappear, as the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) said:\n \"The Devil places his hose on the heart of the son of Adam,\n\n\"When Allah is mentioned, the heart feels at ease.\"",
